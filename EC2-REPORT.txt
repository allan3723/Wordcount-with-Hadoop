For the word count, there was only one map and one reduce. For the bigram counter, there were two maps and one reduce. 

This difference is attributed to the number of keys it need to obtain before it makes the <key, value> pair. In word count, we only need to get one key, which is each word in each line. However, in bigram, we had to find two keys: a word in the line and it's adjacent word and combine them into one key. In a way, finding these two keys could be seen as doubling the DFS block size of the input files which made it require 2 mappers to do this job.

The reducer is the same in both job because it is still fed in one unique <key, value> pair to be summed up and displayed.
